# Machine-Learning-webapp-using-streamlit
This repository contains a user-friendly Machine Learning Web Application developed using Streamlit. The app's primary function is to determine whether the provided market data belongs to the US market or not. It achieves this task through a straightforward binary classification model powered by the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm.


## Features

- Streamlit Interface: The application offers a simple and intuitive interface designed with Streamlit for easy interaction and data visualization.

- Gaussian Naive Bayes Model: The core of the application is a binary classification model based on the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm. This model efficiently categorizes market data into US and non-US markets.

- Data Preprocessing: Robust data preprocessing techniques ensure that input data is properly formatted and cleaned before being used for classification.

- Real-Time Classification: Users can input market data and receive instant predictions regarding its classification, providing quick insights.
